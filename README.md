# scratch3.0
This repository contains files downloaded from the Scratch 3.0 beta site which does not save or share work yet.

If you want to use these files then download them to your computer and then use the upload option on the File menu in Scratch 3.0 to see them in the beta site. Where I have used microbit in the title, you will also need a microbit to use the project as intended.

Files Included:

Scratch_microbit_play.sb3 - Some early experimenting with the new Scratch interface

SpaceCraft-microbit.sb3 - Uses the tilt sensor to control an onscreen spaceship. Put the microbit in a toy spaceship for more fun!

Wand-microbit.sb3 - uses the When moved/jumped/shaken block to detect when the microbit is used in a wand like motion.
